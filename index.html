	Blood.<br>
	<br>It flows like rivers down the sheets as her breathing slows to an aching halt. She’s still, a landscape of hills and mountains lying motionless on the bed, bleeding life and colour into the sheets. The small rectangular burn at the back of her neck is exposed because of the unnatural angle I left her neck in.<br>
	<br>She was <strong>Haunted.</strong><br>
	<br>And I am her <strong>Savior.</strong><br>
	<br>The silence of the apartment is crushed as the noise from the streets stampedes over it. Today is the day this great city was founded, and those who are blinded by its greatness are outside celebrating in the streets. I felt my stomach grumble, and I look at the woman who was still and dead in front of me. The moonlight mixed with the warm light of the streets to flow through the window and envelop her. She was gorgeous. Blonde hair cascaded over her body, providing her with some modesty. Her wooden eyes stared aimlessly in front of her. She did not look surprised, as if my presence was of no concern to her.<br>
	<br>Not her.<br>
	<br>Her and her beauty will stay here, eternally scorched into my brain, like the fire of life I stole from her. I was hungry. And there was only one thing that could satisfy that hunger. I stopped trying to control the beast inside me. The beast that knows how it goes: I kill them and it feasts. There are no exceptions. I give it a meal in order to have it grace me with its power. An escape.<br>
	<br>Wind tumbles through the open window, swaying the curtains, who begin to dance to his silent music. I stare at them, transfixed by their subtle dance, following their hips in their seductive motion, the circles their legs create, the nodding of their heads. They wave me over, these she-devils, these angels, and how can I say no. I walk into their embrace, their soft skin against mine, but they avoid the blood on my face. They don’t hate me for what I have done. Why would they? I saved her.<br>
	<br>I turn back to the woman, the object of my love. I feel my body relax as I look at her, and I begin to revert back to what I used to be. The dark crimson that covers her bed reveals the pearlescent bones beneath. The hollow cavity in her chest that the beast created served to remind me that the beast and I are no longer separate things. We are one and the same. Its name is my own.<br>
	<br>And you. You are trespassing.<br>
	<br>Footsteps tiptoed into my ears. They were coming from the hall. The conversation between two men filled the room, and just as I was about to break away from my love, light from the hall barges into the room. A young man stares at me, surrounded by a halo of artificial light. I stare back at him and smile, revealing the sharp teeth that are mine and the beast’s.<br>
	<p class="maneater"><i style="font-size: 18px;color:red;font-family: 'Lacquer';">“I saved her,” </i> I say.<br></p>
	<p class="maneater">He doesn’t answer me. He doesn’t need to. He is well aware of what I have done, and who I am. I turn to leave.<br>
	<br>His voice stops me, “Maneater.” He’s in shock, that is the only word he can speak, and we are both much too aware of that.</p> 
	<p class="maneater" style="font-size: 18px;color:red;font-family: 'Lacquer';"><i>“That’s my name. Don’t wear it out.”</i></p>
	<p class="maneater">And without looking to see his reaction, I jump out of the window.
</p>
<br><p class="maneater">--|--</p><br>
<p class="maneater">
	You’re still here. Stories and floors fly by as I fall to the ground, but you, you’re still here. It wasn’t just that room. You’re still here, in my mind, reading my thoughts. Would you like to introduce yourself?<br>
	<br>Five stories.<br>
	<br>I focus on changing my body. Channeling the life I stole from the woman, I shrink my body, grow black feathers, and a jagged, toothy beek, letting my previous form melt away. The morph happens just in time, and I spread my wings, saving myself from a deadly fall. I soar into the air, high above the streets lit up by red and yellow lights, banners and streamers. The noise from the streets is deafening and I can’t help but be disgusted. These people are celebrating the fall of freedom and have become slaves to the totalitarian leaders that scheme behind closed doors. I look down and see how the parades of people wear hairstyles that show of the back of their neck, the burnt mark of the Procedure emblazoned with red and gold paint, as if there is some kind of pride in becoming a husk of your former self, a body that the government controls, a fucking robot going by the code prodramed into it by people they will never know, never see, but trust anyway because everyone around them does, so why not? They are the proud Haunted. They are the people I need to save.<br>
	<br>I honestly wish I could have as much fun as the people below me are having, but I cannot ignore what has been done to citizens of this city. I will free them. I just need time.<br>
	<br>The fact that you’re still here is getting annoying. What the hell do you want? Applause? Gratitude? The fuck are you reading my thoughts for? Yes I’m talking to you. What you thought it would be fun to dig around in someone else’s experiences? Are you so bored that you have nothing better to do than to read about experiences that will never affect you and will never be a part of your life?<br>
	<br>But this is your only escape, isn’t it?<br>
	<br>I start to see the walls of the inner city come towards me and then pass me as I travel from the white towers that challenge the sky to the rubble riden ruins of the outer city. This is the place I call my makeshift home, and honestly I'm only here because it's the easiest place to hide. Though it probably won't take them long to figure out I'm here.<br>
	<br>Still there, huh? I guess telling you to fuck off won’t make you go away either. No? Fuck I don’t have time for this. Keep reading, whatever, I don’t care. Just don’t blame me if you find something you don’t particularly like. You got yourself into this, so you only have yourself to blame.<br>
	<br>The outer city, or the slums as most call it, was celebrating in their own way. Not with the extravagance of the inner city, but I could see people chanting and dancing, more than happy to celebrate the administration that shafted them into this pathetic situation. Their homes are ruins from a time long forgotten, they only get the bare necessities, with every tiny luxury being smuggled in, and yet, and yet, they celebrate. That’s what years of subjugation does to you. At some point you kiss the hand that both feeds you and beats you. As much as all this infuriates me, I can’t blame these people. They are just the victims of this war. But not to worry. I will finally rip this city’s precious veil away, and then there will be nothing left. Nothing but the people and their new freedom.<br>
	<br>I search for the blue tarp of makeshift home. It may look no different than all the other blue tarps that speckle the rooftops of the slums, but I added a fun hint that points to mine in ultraviolet paint. A splatter on the tarp of one of my further neighbours that points to my own. You may not be able to see it with the human eye, but with a raven's eyes that that splatter glows like a neon sign. It signals home for me, and I vear towards it.<br>

	<h1 style="color: #090d18">SECOND CONTACT</h1>
	<p class="cJulania">
		I stumble back to my home tired and exhausted. Founding day is always very fun, but it’s hard to celebrate in the streets for hours without feeling like death. I open the door to see my parents are already home. My dad, an average looking guy with a buzz cut head and a smooth shaven face, has a twinkle in his brown eyes. He sits at the table in his business suit, with his celebratory red and gold tie worn proudly on this neck, the Republi lion laying flat on his chest. Mother was laying down a dish adorned with red and gold flowers which held a fruit salad, decorated at the top with an edible gold lion. Mom is dressed in a richly decorated red and gold dress, her black hair braided, with red roses in her hair. Around her neck was a gold necklace weighed down by a large Republi lion pendant, it’s ruby eyes glistening happily in the light. The table is covered in festive food on decorated plates on a red tablecloth, but one thing at the center of the table drew my attention. A giant plush Republi lion sat in the center on the table, and it held a gold gift box in his jaw.<br>
		<br>“Surprise!” my parents said in unison. Suddenly, my school friends jump out from behind the counter in the kitchen. “Happy birthday, Julania!”<br>
		<br>I expected some kind of celebration today, but this is the first time my parents invited my friends over. I couldn’t help but smile. Jak, dressed in a bright red suit with a gold tie, vaulted over the counter and ran over to me, immediately falling to his knees. He clearly had practiced this maneuver before, because as he gracefully landed, he smoothly pulled out a small velvet box with a gold bow on it.<br>
		<br>“For you, m’lady,” he says, looking up at me eagerly.<br>
		<br>I can’t stop the warmth that suddenly grows on my face. He’s blushing too. I gently take the small package out of his hands and nod to him in thanks. He gets up, practically jumping with excitement.<br>
		<br>“Open it! Open it!” Molei and Sant chanted from behind the counter.<br>
		<br>“Now, now,” my mother stops them, “gifts can be opened after dinner.”<br>
		<br>I sigh and shrug at Jak. He seems a lot sadder now, but there’s still fire in his eyes. I look at the small box in my hands. It doesn’t feel too heavy. What could he have gotten me?<br>
		<br>As everyone sits down at the table, Molei and Sant put their gifts near the plush lion at the center of the table. Sant brought a large gift that was messily wrapped in red paper, on top of which there is a gold ribbon barely holding the paper together. Molei’s gift is smaller. It is in a heart shaped box, also red with a gold ribbon, but also has a button on the top, shaped like the Republi lion. I put Jak’s gift with the rest, studying the packages to figure out the contents inside. My mom and dad are already putting food on everyone’s plates and pouring drinks. As they sat back down we broke into customary chatter, but I’m not paying attention to it. Food and drink enter my mouth, words leave it, but I don’t feel like I’m actually there. I feel like I’m a stranger in a body that is among friends. I stay in this daze throughout the meal, all the way till it was time to open gifts.<br>
		We shifted to the living room, where I found even more gift boxes stacked on the coffee table. They all are of various sizes and shapes, but one thing stayed consistent, the red wrapping paper with gold bows.<br>
		<br>“What’s with all the gifts?” I asked.<br>
		<br>“Some are from us, but most of them are from your teachers and the city,” dad answered proudly.<br>
		<br>“The city? Why would they send me gifts?”<br>
		<br>“You’re our magic child!” Molei says waving her hands in the air. “Born on Founding Day and reached her 18th birthday on Republi’s anniversary, no wonder they're sending you gifts.”<br>
		<br>I was somehow important because of a complete coincidence? It feels gross to think that. I look at the happy Republi lion plush who’s now sitting on pile of presents. The lion is a symbol of loyalty and protection. It is always all around me. I picked up the red card with the Republi lion printed onto it in shining gold ink. I feel my face force itself to smile, even though I don't want to, even though I don't feel like I deserve this. I hear myself read the card out loud but it doesn't sound like my voice. I laugh and chat with everyone, but it's not longer me talking. Why do I feel so sad on such a special day? I open gifts, I act surprised at each one, I give thanks to the gift giver, I try on the clothes and jewelry, but none of these actions are done by me. My body was moving on its own without my consent. It's just the same act I’ve been doing every year, happy to be alive among friends, with my family, yet every single time it feels hollow. Jak had given me a silver dog pendant, and I’m wearing it around my neck. Molei gave me a new telecom with a better camera, and I’m using it to take photos with my friends, parents, and my new plush lion. Sant got me a new speaker system, and I’m testing it with my favourite music. My parents got me an embellished Republi broach, and I’m putting it on. All of this feels wrong. I don't deserve these luxuries. I haven't done anything worthwhile in my life. Suddenly, the monitor in our wall flashes to life.

	Once I land on my rooftop, I morph back into my original form. I am exhausted, and I have a feeling these festivities won’t let me sleep anytime soon. I look at my humble abode and watch as the red and yellow lights from the inner city faintly reflect off of my shelter’s shiny roof. All my things are in their own creaking homes, like dog houses, but for food, clothing, appliances, and miscellaneous items. Something feels off. The crude tent I made using a plastic tarp and rusting poles, held together by zip ties, had lights wrapped around the entrance and the back frame for lighting, but this time there was a pile of smaller new lights wrapped around the entrance as well. They didn't look too functional, like they are more decorative than for actual lighting. Beside my shelter I notice a note printed on a bright red card with a gold letter script. I am pretty sure who visited now. I sigh and turn on my electricity using the button embedded into the cement of my building’s rooftop. Sure enough, as my normal lights flicker on, so do the new lights, and they glow red and yellow. I grab the card and plop onto my bed to read it.<br></p>

	<br><p class="maneater">On the back of the card the gold lion of Republi was emblazoned in the same gold ink as the text. I put the card down on the floor and lay down on my bed. I don't like the government messing with my stuff, but it would have been too suspicious if I owned an unauthorized shelter. Sadly, as an authorized citizen, I have to deal with this shit. The lights did add a nice ambient glow to my simple home, but I can’t ignore where they came from. Yet, I still get lost in the glow, it feels warm and friendly, like there is nothing that will hurt me, like it will protect me. I hear it saying to me, Stay here, why would you ever want to leave? Why continue this silly quest of yours? And I want to stay in that glow. I want to feel safe. I want to be protected. I want to have a normal life, be a normal citizen, find a good partner, raise a family, have a proper home in the inner city.<br>
	<br>But we don’t always get what we want.<br>
	<br>I get up to turn the lights off when I feel my telecom vibrate from underneath my pillow. I had left it there to charge. I reach for it and see a familiar face on the screen. I focus on morphing into a different form: one with a taller, more athletic body, and with pitch black hair and eyes. I grab the telecom and answer it.<br>
	<br>On the other end I hear a familiar voice say,<br>“Hey, Pitch, you might want to look at the monitors outside.”<br>
</p><br><br>
<p class="julania">
	“BREAKING NEWS!” it blares, with the Republi crest on the screen. “This is an important government announcement! Stop what you are doing at once and give your full attention to this broadcast.”<br>
	<br>I look out the window and see a raven fly by. Bad omen. Two reporters appear on screen. “Just minutes ago a man has reported a murder in the blue district. The woman killed was Samantha Holloway, a twenty-six year old accountant, who had just recently gone through the Procedure. Due to the brutal state her body was left in, no images of this event will be shown, but authorities did want us to note that her body looked like it had been chewed by an animal.”<br>
	<br>I look over at Jak, Molei, and Sant. “Maneater,” we whisper. My mother shushes us. The broadcast continues, “We advise all residents of the blue district to lock their doors and windows, and stay inside as the criminal is still at large.”<br>
	<br>My father immediately rushes over to the front door and locks it. My mother does the same with all of the widows, rushing from room to room, checking off rooms out loud to herself. The broadcast somehow brought me back to life. I don't feel like I am doing a routine act, and instead I am here, in the moment, terrified. I look over at my friends, and there is an unspoken understanding between us. This isn't going to stop until they catch him. Maneater is going to continue killing and eating people.<br>
	<br>Understandably worried, my mom tells my friends, “You should probably stay the night, dears.”<br>
	<br>Normally I would be ecstatic to have a sleepover like this, but the circumstances made it much less pleasant. We listen to the broadcast to completion.<br>
	<br>“New evidence of who this mysterious killer has arised, as there was a witness on the scene.” I perk up at “witness.” Did someone actually get to see this guy? “We now go to an interview with the only witness of this crazed murderer, Daneel Halberg.”<br>
	<br>The screen now showed the shaking late-twenties man with disheveled hair and unkempt stubble. He was wrapped in a silver blanket and you can see the shock and grief he carried in his cold brown eyes. It seems like the reporters and police tried to comfort them, but with no avail. The man is whispering to himself something unintelligible, but at some point I swear he said “he said it was his name.” The concerned reporter looks over at the man and gently says, “Mr. Halberg, could you tell us what you saw?”<br>
	<br>Halberg looks up at her, he lets out a sob, and says, “H-he was standing o-over her, like s-some kind of g-g-grim reaper. H-he had huge claws instead of hands and was so thin and lanky and his teeth were sharp like knives and his eyes, his eyes, they st-tared into your soul, there was nothing behind those eyes. T-they were like i-ice. Cold. So cold. I c-c-called him Maneater and, and, and he said t-that was his name. Maneater. That was his name. Then he jumped out the window and was gone. Oh, but what he did to my poor Sammy.” The man began rocking back and forth in his seat. “I couldn’t recognize her anymore. There was so much blood. The blood was everywhere.” The man couldn’t contain himself and began crying.<br>
	<br>“Mr. Halberg, could you tell us what colour his eyes were?”<br>
	<br>But at that point Halberg was too far gone. The reporter tries a few more times, but it’s only causing the man more pain. I couldn’t continue watching. We try to have cake, but the death of the woman from our district and her broken boyfriend hang over us like a storm cloud. As we prepared for bed, my friends and I whisper to each other the different rumors we’ve heard about the murderer at school. This was Maneater’s fifth kill now, and theories about who he could possibly be and why he kills innocent people and eats them were rampant throughout the city. Sant is noticeably disturbed and I understand why. The way the man from the news described Maneater in the broadcast pointed to Maneater being a hybrid, and Sant’s older brother was a hybrid.<br>
	<br>I try to comfort Sant by putting my hand on his shoulder and saying, “Don’t worry, they’re not going to take Gambin.”<br>

		Fourth of Julan, 23:00<br><br><br>
		I walk into my office to find nothing out of the ordinary. The white desk is covered in the usual tech: holocaster, computer, telecom, monitor, holopad and stylus. Everything is as I left it last night. It is Founding Day, so I am not supposed to have to come in for work, but this is an emergency. I am not surprised. This was bound to happen with a murderer on the loose. I sit down and start pulling work from the last few months. Information for each case, filed and dated, opens up as monitors and holocasters flicker to life. I don't bother turning on the lights provided in the room, the monitors and holocasters provide plenty of light on their own. Their cool glow also helps to wake me up and focus on the task ahead. I move on to checking if the information on today's incident is accessible. A locked file greets me in the database, dated 4.13.250. Today. I was not provided with the access code, which honestly did not bother me. I designed the algorithm that determines the “random” number and letter combination that is used as the password for each new file created on the government database. There are four files between this file and the last one I needed to access, so the password is cRp29Lnvfa5xzquBJXyH. I type that in and set the file to download. I move the download screen onto a new holoscreen and start pulling up my notes from the previous incidents. That goes on a new holoscreen and I open up a new document on my main monitor, date it, I start the document with the time, 23:02, and-<br><br>
		Footsteps: fast pace, short stomp, higher pitch, slight increase in weight on the right leg.<br><br>Stacy.<br><br>
		She's early. It usually takes her five minutes to get to my office. Considering the lack of change in her pace there are two options: she was called in early or she took today as a work day. I'm higher up than her, so she would not have been called before. She took today as a work day. Stupid of her. She’s not going to find anything with the pitiful evidence we have.<br><br>
		Download is done.<br><br>
		I start pouring over the file just as Stacy barges in, tablet and thin cards held in her right hand close to her chest.<br><br>
		She begins, “I can't believe they're bringing us in on-”<br><br>
		“You came in to work on the case today.” I interrupt her without looking away from the screen.<br><br>
		“You preemptively chose not to take the day off. What did you expect to find?”<br><br>
		“How did y- You came in at 23 o’clock, it's 23 o’five-”<br><br>
		“O’two.”<br><br>
		“Same difference!”<br><br>
		“It's that difference that gave you away.”<br><br>
		“Stop it!”<br><br>
		I raise my hand, showing my five fingers, and mouth, “Five minutes.”<br><br>
		“Oh screw you. At least I'm not an uptight prick that counts all these things.”<br><br>
		“That counting got me this job.” I want some caffeine to wake me up. I open up the food menu on my monitor and click coffee.<br><br>
		“Anyway, I got you the access code for the case file.”<br><br>
		“Already reading it.”<br><br>
		“It's locked.”<br><br>
		“Lucky guess.”<br><br>
		Her arm drops to her side. “Hope, you need to stop doing this.” She says exasperated.<br><br>
		I finally turn to her, “Taking advantage of my knowledge saves us time. Every second is precious in a case like this.”<br><br>
		“And has saving every second help you figure out who the killer is?”<br><br>
		“Not yet.” I admit.<br><br>
		“Do you have any leads?”<br><br>
		“No.”<br><br>
		She slams her sheets of card onto the table. “Well, I do.”<br><br>
		I pick them up tentatively, “What is this?”<br><br>
		“A transcript of my interview with our one and only witness.”<br><br>
		I look up at her, with my eyebrow raised, “There's nothing in the file about a witness.”<br><br>
		“Because I haven't added that to the file yet.” she smiles.<br><br>
		“You should have uploaded it right away.” I say as I put the cards through a holoscaner one by one.<br><br>
		“I haven't edited them yet. Those are the raws.”<br><br>
		“Right– Summary?”<br><br>
		“Our killer is most likely a hybrid.”<br><br>
		My coffee pops up from a slot in the table just as she says “hybrid.”<br><br>
		I stare at her in disbelief. “A hybrid?” I'm hoping that she misspoke. That she didn’t mean it. That-<br><br>
		“Yes. A hybrid.”

<p class="julania">
	Sant nods, but it doesn’t seem like he’s calmed down about it.<br>
	<br>“This guy is such bullshit!” Molei exclaims, “Now everyone is going to be even more hostile to hybrids! Everyone is just going to see them as murder monsters!”<br>
	<br>Sant droops even more from Molei’s statement.<br>
	<br>“Would you shut up? Can’t you see Sant is worried about his brother?” Jak snaps. He looks over at me. “I feel bad for Julania, her birthday was completely ruined by that report.”<br>
	<br>I force a smile, “It’s not completely ruined. We can still have a fun night.”<br>
	<br>“You know I heard that hybrids can’t control their primal urges when they first morph. Maybe Maneater isn’t one man, but different hybrids going feral and killing the people they live with.” Molei says as if she is telling some ghost story. “You never know, maybe one of us will suddenly go feral as we submit to the power of the beast.”<br>
	<br>Sant whimpers.<br>
	<br>“Molei, drop it.” Jak says sternly. “You’re not helping.”<br>
	<br>“How about we get some rest,” I suggest, tucking myself into bed with my plush lion. “Break starts tomorrow, so we can do something fun to get all our minds off this.”<br>
	<br>I don’t wait for an answer, and immediately lie down and pretend to sleep. I listen as everyone else slowly lies down and pulls their blankets over themselves. I’m not thinking about what I want to do tomorrow, but what I found out this morning: a spec of golden yellow in the brown iris of my left eye.<br>
</p><br><br>
<p class="hope">
	I put my head in my hands. She's so proud of herself. She got us a lead. But a lead to what?<br><br>
	“What’s wrong?” she asks. She doesn't understand the ramifications of this discovery.<br><br>
	“Please tell me you didn't let the press interview the witness.”<br><br>
	“You know I'm obligated to. Hope, what's wrong?”<br><br>
	I grab my coffee and take a sip. It tastes bitter in my mouth, sweetness lost to the events at hand. “Where’s the witness now?”<br><br>
	“He’s at home. Why?”<br><br>
	“Have you gone mad?” I exclaim.<br><br>
	“Wha-”<br><br>
	“Has the broadcast been aired?”<br><br>
	“You just missed it. Why d-”<br><br>
	I get up and rush to grab my coat and arms hanging on the wall. “Send me the address. Call any enforcement in the area. Tell them to bring anti-hybrid arms.”<br><br>
	“Hope! What's wrong?”<br><br>
	“Do it, Stacy! Or we’ll have a dead man on our hands!”<br><br>
	She goes pale. I could almost see the gears working in her head. She connects two and two together. The fear in her soft brown eyes told me everything. She immediately turns on the holocaster on her wrist, types up the address and swipes it to me. The address appears on my holocaster:</p>
	<p style="font-family: 'Turret Road'; font-size: 22px; text-align: center; color: #00C2D1;">03-07-26 Blue District<br></p>
	<p class="hope">I press the projected button underneath it and set it as the next destination of my vehicle. I can hear Stacy talking to the enforcement manager, who already has his hands full with the mass panic in his district.<br><br>
	“We are doing all that we can to make sure everyone is safe, Detective.” he says lazily, clearly he’s not taking this as seriously as he should.<br><br>
	“I am not asking you to make sure everyone is safe, I’m asking you to protect the one man.” Stacy practically yells. “There is a very high likelihood that while you’re spread thin the murderer will kill the only witness in this case.”<br><br>
	“Detective, there’s honestly nothing w-”<br><br>
	“I want you to send a group of your best men in anti-hybrid gear immediately, Manager!” she yells. “That’s an order!”<br><br>
	I move to walk out of the office, but Stacy stops me.<br><br>
	“You’re not going without me.” she mouths.<br><br>
	“We’re going now.” I mouth back.<br><br>
	She nods, and we both head out at a quick pace, passing by Stacy’s desk, so she can grab her coat and arms. She puts them on as we rush the lift down and get into my vehicle. The moment we’re it, it speeds off to the blue district.<br><br>
	“What time was the broadcast?” I ask.<br><br>
	“22:55, or something like that.” she answers. She’s done putting on her gear and has one of her anti-hybrid weapons drawn.<br><br>
	“We might just barely make it.”<br><br>
	“You taking the direct route?”<br><br>
	“There’s no time for lifts.”<br><br>
	She nods. I take out my own anti-hybrid weapon. It’s weight feels strange in my hands. I study it’s square barrel and soft grip. It’s made to fit my hand like a glove, but it feels out of place in my hands. Stacy’s breathing is calm, measured and slow. She’s looking at the door on her side, ready to kick it open at a moment’s notice. I don’t feel her confidence. I’m shaking. Considering how long ago the broadcast was, there is at least a 34% chance we would come before the killer. The higher likelihood, at 62% right now, was that the killer would come at the same or similar time as us. I look out the window of my vehicle door, and study the landscape around me to distract me from impending events.I watch sleek white towers that reach the sky whiz past. They all have disperate glowing windows that don’t interrupt the sleek shells surrounding their source. But the man that is my reflection distracts me. I try to focus on the vehicles passing us, but I find myself staring at my reflection once more. I turn to look at Stacy before the memories come back. She doesn’t need to look at me to know that I am worried.<br><br>
	“Just remember your training,” she says softly. “If anything happens, I got your back.”<br><br>
	I don’t get to breathe a sigh of relief before my vehicle slows to a halt and the doors fly open. Stacy is out immediately, weapon at her side on the ready, and her holocarter projecting a map of where to go. I step out after her, making sure my arms are not shaking, and briskly get in front of her. I don’t need a map, I have the whole city memorized. I veer to the witness’s apartment, and I’m glad to be greeted by four enforcement officers dressed in full Republi gear. The black visors of their red and gold helmets cover their faces, but their stance and pacing back and forth says it all. They’re terrified.<br><br>
	“Detectives!” They say in unison and salute.<br><br>
	“At ease,” I say calmly, masking my nervousness. “What's the situation?”<br><br>
	One of the officers closest to me steps forward and salutes, “The witness is in his apartment. All doors and windows are locked. A copter is outside as we speak, ready to take down anyone that attempts to scale the building. The location is secure.”<br><br>
	I nod to him, “You’ve done well, I'll make sure to -”<br><br>
	A loud crash coming from outside interrupts me. I start to hear sirens and commotion.<br><br>
	He's here.<br><br>
	I don't hesitate.<br><br>
	I rush to the door and hear a familiar click as it unlocks automatically for me. Stacy is right behind me, weapon no longer at her side but in front of her, ready to shoot. I take out my weapon.<br><br>
	There's commotion in the bedroom.<br><br>
	Thankfully all Republi apartments are standardized, so I don't lose my focus as I nod to the door. Stacy immediately kicks the door in and walks in with me close behind her.<br><br>
	I feel nauseous as I walk into the room.<br><br>
	The floor and walls are covered in blood. The bed sheets were soaked with it and on them lay a mess of bones, tissue and organs that I could only assume used to be our witness.<br><br>
	Stacy pulls the trigger and I hear a loud clang.<br><br>
	I turn to the shadowy mess that is our killer, who has his back to us. He doesn't seem to be affected by the bullet. Stacy takes another shot. I watch the shadowy mess dodge it smoothly, as if not giving it second thought. He turns around, and my hands no longer listen to me. They raise my gun and shake uncontrollably. I know I need to steady them to take a shot, but what I see in front of me prevents me from doing so. This monster, with a human stance, matted black fur, long silvery claws, grins at me revealing the rows of needle like teeth. Eye colour, I tell myself. I need to narrow it down. But as I gaze up into his eyes, all I see is coldness and a hint of amusement.<br><br>
	Stacy takes a few shots in quick succession. But this time the fur on his body shifts, and I watch each bullet bounce off him and hit the wall. His eyes don't leave me. I hear Stacy grabbing another weapon, but before she gets to use it, I hear a deep rasping voice say,<br><i style="font-size: 18px;color:#7f0000;font-family: 'Lacquer';">“I'm so glad they sent you after me, Detective.”</i><br><br>
	He stalks toward me like a cat stalking its prey.<br><i style="font-size: 18px;color:#7f0000;font-family: 'Lacquer';">“Have the government approved freak catch the freak the government can't seem to get rid of.”</i><br><br>
	His voice sends chills down my spine. I feel my knees weaken as my whole body begins to shake. Stacy pulls the trigger of a different weapon this time. The killer smoothly dodges it once more, leaving a giant crater in the wall. She prepares to take another shot. Suddenly I hear footsteps heading in our direction. 
	Reinforcements. Thank Republi.<br><br>
	The killer hears them too. He turns to Stacy. “You have one last shot before I leave.”<br><br>
	Stacy takes it, but as expected the killer jumps out the way, landing on all fours.<br><br>
	“See you soon, detectives.” He says and then leaps out the window.<br><br>
	Officers rush in, Stacy is yelling orders, but I stand there transfixed by what I saw.<br><br>
	Even though I was face to face with the killer, I don't know where to go with this investigation.<br><br>
